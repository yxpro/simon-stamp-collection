# About Simon's Stamps

Simon has been collecting stamps since 1988.

He has rare stamps from all over the world, even Mogadishu.

It's a boring hobby, but Simom enjoys it and gets paid hella bank selling to rich jamokes.

Fast-forward, Simon has decided to give stamp collecting a break.

It was fun while it was paying the bills, but appreciation for stamp collecting has dwindled in the new millenium,
as folks have wised up to the fact that it's really lame as far as hobbies go.

Poor Simon.
